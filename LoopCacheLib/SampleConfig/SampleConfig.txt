# LoopCache sample configuration file
#
# All nodes need their own local config file.
# There is a single master per cluster.
# The master and data nodes can all be run on a single development machine
# by starting listeners in different consoles, with different config files.
#
# Blank lines and lines starting with a hash mark are ignored

# All instances need to know where the master is

# Master	host:port			
Master		localhost:12345	

# The local listener.  Data nodes start by contacting master for the ring configuration, 
# and then they scan the list of nodes for their own config using the host and port below.

# Listener		host		ip:port				IsMaster Yes|No
Listener		localhost	127.0.0.1:12345		Yes

# Trace		On|Off		File
Trace		On			C:\Loop\Logs\LoopCacheMaster.txt

# Only the master needs nodes to be defined.  Nodes ask the master for their configuration, 
# which only consists of MaxNumBytes for now.  The master listener can be a data node, simply
# add it here, with the same listener port as in the Master line above.

# Node	host:port			MaxNumBytes
Node	localhost:12346		24Mb
Node	localhost:12347		64Mb
Node	localhost:12348		48Mb
